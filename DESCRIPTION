Description: Implements methods for selecting the number of factors in Poisson
  factor models, with a primary focus on Thinning Cross-Validation (TCV). The
  TCV method is based on the 'data thinning' technique, which probabilistically
  partitions each count observation into training and test sets while preserving
  the underlying factor structure. The Poisson factor model is then fit on the
  training set, and model selection is performed by comparing predictive
  performance on the test set. This toolkit is designed for researchers working
  with high-dimensional count data in fields such as genomics, text mining, and
  social sciences. The data thinning methodology is detailed in Dharamshi et al.
